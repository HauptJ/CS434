# CS 434 Advanced Databases
SIUE CS 434 Fall 16

Semester long group project in which we created a Mariadb / MySQL database using crime data provided by the city of Los Angeles California. 

[LA Public Safety Data](https://data.lacity.org/browse?category=A+Safe+City "LA Public Safety Data"). We used the crime data from 2010 to present dataset and used random fake data for police officers as those were not provided.

The project was hosted on a Centos 7 cloud server runnig Centmin Mod.
